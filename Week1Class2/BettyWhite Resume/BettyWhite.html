<p>The series revolves around four older, single women &lpar;three widows and one divorc&eacute;e&rpar; sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux &lpar;Rue McClanahan&rpar;, who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund &lpar;Betty White&rpar; and divorc&eacute;e Dorothy Zbornak &lpar;Bea Arthur&rpar;. They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco &lpar;Charles Levin&rpar;, who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo &lpar;Estelle Getty&rpar;, after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
